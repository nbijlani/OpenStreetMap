# OpenStreetMap
Data wrangling on OpenStreetMap data:

The goal of this project is to work with a selected geographical area of interest from the openstreetmap.org database
to audit data definition problems, clean the problematic data, import the cleaned data into an SQL database,
and run suitable queries to analyze the data in order to gain insight.
In short, this is a practical exercise in data wrangling, which is perhaps the most vital and the most time-consuming part 
of most data analysis projects.

The dataset was downloaded from https://www.openstreetmap.org in the XML OSM format.
I chose the geographical area defining the area in and around where I live. 
This includes the Borough of Elmbridge and surrounding areas â€“ Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, Hersham, Esher, 
and parts of other adjacent towns. The data boundaries are as follows: 
Min. longitude: -0.5294, Max. longitude: -0.3360 
Min. latitude: 51.3374, Max. latitude: 51.4216

Please read the project pdf for the details of the data wrangling process.
